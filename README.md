## About

This project offers the official implementation of the segment-based light transport simulation framework introduced in our SIGGRAPH 2025 paper. We hope it serves as a helpful reference for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring our new approach to light transport simulation.

## Code Release

The code will be made available soon. Please stay tuned for updates.
