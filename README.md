# Segment-based Light Transport Simulation

Welcome to the reference implementation of the framework presented in our paper:

**Segment-based Light Transport Simulation**  
*ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proceedings of SIGGRAPH 2025)*

## About

This project offers the official implementation of the segment-based light transport simulation framework introduced in our SIGGRAPH 2025 paper. We hope it serves as a helpful reference for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring our new approach to light transport simulation.

## Code Release

**I am currently busy with ongoing work and, for now, can’t provide a timeline for releasing the full codebase. That said, making the code available is still something I intend to do when circumstances allow.** Please stay tuned for updates.
